### **Abstract**:
Environmental temperatures are increasing worldwide, threatening desert ectotherms already living at their thermal limits. Organisms with flexible thermoregulatory behaviours may be able to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures by moving among microhabitats, yet little work has tracked movement patterns of desert ectotherms in the wild over diurnal scales or compared behaviour among seasons. Here, we used camera traps to track the thermoregulatory behaviour and microhabitat choices of 30 desert lizards (_Messalina bahaldini_) in custom, outdoor arenas that provided access to open, rock, and bush microhabitats. We found that in the summer, lizards preferred to move to the shaded microhabitats and remain there under warmer conditions. During winter, however, lizardsâ€™ activity was not related to temperature, and lizards mostly chose to remain in the open habitat. Interestingly, in both seasons, lizards tended to remain in their current microhabitat and moved infrequently between certain combinations of microhabitats. Our study shows that thermoregulation (shade-seeking behaviour) is a major factor during summer, helping lizards to avoid extreme temperatures, but not during winter, and shows a novel effect of current microhabitat on movement, suggesting that other biotic or abiotic factors may also drive microhabitat choice. Understanding the complex factors at play in microhabitat choice is critical for developing conservation programs that effectively mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on desert animals.
